Talk about programming languages
    Specifically about Domain Specific Language Design


May want to talk about parser generators
    Yacc and Lex specifically, along with the fact that this is a solved problem where as very few type checker generators

^^ These are probably less important as they are not explicitly about type systems

Talk about type systems in general along with the complexity of type systems
    Type systems, so type rules, natural deduction logic
    Type system safety

Talk about type checkers
    Type checkers, complex code, hand written, ad hoc

Talk about type checker generators
    Not many exist, Need to look at Ruler and Typical

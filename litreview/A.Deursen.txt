Well defined application domains: Type checking is our given domain

Subroutine libraries, Object-orientated frameworks, and Domain Specific Languages

Subroutine libraries: can be useful but having a concrete syntax and limits what can be a well formed type system since it has to belong to a given grammar

Object-Orientated Framework: A continuation of subroutine libraries but using object orientation.

Domain Specific Language: small usually declarative language that offers expressive power focused on a particular problem. DSL programs are translated to calls to a common subroutine library and the DSL can be viewed to hide the details of the library


DSL: given definition: a DSL is a programming language that offers, through appropriate notations and abstractions, expressive power focused on and usually restricted to a particular problem domain

focussed expressive power

DSLs are small Languages

They do however offer GPL as a sub language eg YACC

\section{The JET Language}

JET allows the user to write type rules that will be generated into Haskell code.
In order to do that the user may have to write some Haskell code in an initial section.
For this reason JET consists of two parts: some Haskell code in an initial section, followed by a list of type rules.

In order to write a type system in JET, the user will also be proved with a Haskell type class that defines a number of functions that will be useful when interacting with the context, such as looking up a variable in the context and adding an item to the context.
This type class has been written in such a way to support as many contexts as possible as to not limit what type of languages JET supports.
Along with the type class, there will also be an example of how to implement an instance of the type class using a Haskell map as an example.

\subsection{Initial Inline Haskell}
The code that comes at the top of a JET type specification is a block of inline Haskell code.
This will be put inline at the top of the generated output code.
This is where a user can define useful functions and types that will be needed later.
For example this is where a user can define the type for the context along with defining the instance of the type class JetContext for the users custom context type.
It also allows for the ability to import any other haskell modules, this means that the user can import their Abstract Syntax Definition for that language that may be defined in a separate Haskell module.
The inline Haskell takes the form of $\{Code\}$ and a user can write any Haskell code they like here.
An example use of of this will be to define the module header, along with the context type declaration, and a instance of the JetContext type class using the context the user has declared.
One such example can be seen in \autoref{lst:inlineHaskellCode}, the listing is an abbreviated example of what appears in the JET type specification for the Ad language which can be seen in \autoref{appendix:AdLanguage}.
Here we define the context to be a 4-tuple which contains the current return type of the current subprogram, along with three namespaces, one for procedures; one for functions; and one for variables.
These namespaces utilise the JetContextMap provided to the user.
JetContextMap is a list of Maps, where each Map is a scope in the code.
The instance of JetContext for JetContextMap is already defined for the user an example of how to define an instance of JetContext.
The example does not include full definitions for the functions and type classes, full definitions for JetContext can be seen in \autoref{appendix:jetLanguage}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Example of initial inline haskell code, label=lst:inlineHaskellCode]
{
module TypeAd where

Import AbsAd
newtype Context = Context (Type, 
    JetContextMap (Ident, [Type]) Type, 
    JetContextMap (Ident, [Type]) Type, 
    JetContextMap Ident Type)
instance JetContextBase Context where
    emptyContext = 
        Context (TNNone, emptyContext, ...)
    ...
instance JetContext Context ContextKey Type where
    lookupContext (P ident ts) (Context (_, p, _, _)) 
        = lookupContext (ident, ts) p
    ...
updateRetType :: Context -> Type -> Context
-- Other useful functions and definitions
}
\end{lstlisting}

Having this inline code allows the user to specify exactly how they wish the context to function.
It also allows for a set of standard functions that the user can use to interact with the context, along with adding their own custom functions if and when they need them.

\chapter{Method}
I decided that I would design and implement a Domain Specific Language to specify type systems, such that the language is analogous to the natural deduction rules used to define type systems in the mathematics.
This appeared to make the most sense as other parts of the compiler pipeline already have domain specific languages which are used to generate code.

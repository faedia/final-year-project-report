\chapter{State of the Art}

The idea of generating code to be a part of the compiler pipeline is not new.
The first two stages of the frontend of a compiler, the lexical analyser and the syntax analyser (more commonly known as the lexer and the parser), have general tools to generate their code using Domain Specific Languages (DSL)\cite{Bentley:1986:PPL:6424.315691,van2000domain}.
Two such of these languages are Lex, as the lexer generator, and YACC, as the parser generator.
These tools would generate C code to be used to build the rest of a compiler, possibly including a type checker and machine code generation.
These programs have been around for many years, and many derivatives of them have been made to be used with different general purpose programming languages, such as Alex and Happy for Haskell or Jlex and Cup for Java\cite{ranta2012implementing}.
Many languages have been made using these such programs and their respective DSL's, for example the parser for haskell is self-generated by a grammar defined in a piece of Happy code.
However, not all parts of the compiler pipeline have general tools that are widely used.
Although, some such tools do exist\cite{grimm2007typical,ruler:10.1007/11737414_4}.

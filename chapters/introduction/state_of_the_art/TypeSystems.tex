\section{Type Systems}

Many languages have a type system in one form or another with varying degrees of complexity.
Ranging from relatively simple type systems in languages such as C to fairly complex and expressive type systems such as ones in Haskell and Agda.

The concept and implementation of type systems has also existed for almost as long as the concept of higher level language to perform computation.
